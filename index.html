            <!-- About -->

            <section class="about" id="aboutMe">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a child, I learned about the usage of hex color from a close uncle of mine about the same age, and by learning about that I was able to customize my virtual pets on a website called Wajas. Once I got into middle school a website call Myspace began to take hold of social media and I became interested in customizing my profile page so I contacted that relative once again to teach me some of their wizardries. The more curious I became in the frontend of web development, it leads me to want to understand the backend of web development. </p>
                <p>Since the beginning of my journey in web development, I have always been open to teamwork. In high school, I joined an engineering class in which we would create blueprints and render 3D models. It was imperative to be able to work in this class with others. Through working with others I grew to be empathetic, supportive, and a team leader. A great leader needs to learn empathy especially for those who are novices because it shows understanding and the ability to be graceful under pressure. At times it can be frustrating working with a novice but what will help them succeed with the rest of the team is reassurance that they can do it and that I address their call for help.</p>
                <p>On my off time while at home I enjoy analyzing or discussing movie plots, teaching myself Digital Art, and writing fictional stories for my blog. However, when I do find myself out of the house I enjoy trying out new foods, learning, and traveling. Foods worth mentioning in my travels are Blue Heaven's Key Lime pie (Key West, Florida) and Terry Black's Barbeque Brisket. Some of my favorite travel spots would be Weeki Wachee Springs state park, Buc-ee's(the world's largest gas station), and the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas(where you can find Peewee Herman's Bike).  </p>
                <p>Services I would want to provide to my clients are languages such as C#, C++, Java, Javascript, and HTML 5. These languages would cater to clientele who are interested in development for gaming, web, mobile, application, back-end, and more.</p>
