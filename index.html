                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Krystin Ky Lo, and I am currently pursuing an Associate of Science in Mathematics and Physical Science from American River College, with just one credit left to fulfill.</p>
                <p>I completed a Full-stack Software Engineering Immersion program with the Thinkful Bootcamp in 2021. Through this program, I acquired practical skills in cutting-edge technologies, including Javascript, Node.js, CSS, HTML, React, Express, SQL, and Github. I also gained valuable experience in test-driven development with Mocha & Chai.</p>
                <p>During the boot camp, I had the privilege to collaborate with team members and instructors effectively using Slack and GitHub. I participated in several projects, including the Capstone project, where I developed a Restaurant Reservation System. This project involved developing a dashboard for reservation updates, a reservation form, and a search bar that helped restaurants manage customer reservations efficiently.</P>
                <p>Things I Enjoy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital Art</li>
                    <li>Writing</li>

            <!-- About -->

            <section class="about" id="aboutMe">
                <h2>Who am I</h2>
                <p>As a child, I learned about the usage of hex color from a close uncle of mine about the same age, and by learning about that I was able to customize my virtual pets on a website called Wajas. Once I got into middle school a website called Myspace began to take hold of social media and I became interested in customizing my profile page so I contacted that relative once again to teach me some of their wizardries. The more curious I became in the frontend of web development, it leads me to want to understand the backend of web development. </p>
                <p>Since the beginning of my journey in web development, I have always been open to teamwork. In high school, I joined an engineering class in which we would create blueprints and render 3D models. It was imperative to be able to work in this class with others. Through working with others I grew to be empathetic, supportive, and a team leader. A great leader needs to learn empathy especially for those who are novices because it shows understanding and the ability to be graceful under pressure. At times it can be frustrating working with a novice but what will help them succeed with the rest of the team is reassurance that they can do it and that I address their call for help.</p>
                <p>On my off time while at home I enjoy analyzing or discussing movie plots, teaching myself Digital Art, and writing fictional stories for my blog. However, when I do find myself out of the house I enjoy trying out new foods, learning, and traveling. Foods worth mentioning in my travels are Blue Heaven's Key Lime pie (Key West, Florida) and Terry Black's Barbeque Brisket. Some of my favorite travel spots would be Weeki Wachee Springs state park, Buc-ee's(the world's largest gas station), and the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas(where you can find Peewee Herman's Bike).  </p>
                <p>Services I would want to provide to my clients are languages such as C#, C++, Java, Javascript, and HTML 5. These languages would cater to clientele who are interested in development for gaming, web, mobile, application, back-end, and more.</p>
            
                <h2>How Technology Could Change Lives</h2>
                <p>Growing up as a second-generation educated female in a Hmong American family, I learned early on the importance of education and the role it plays in empowering individuals and communities. I saw how my family struggled to navigate complex bureaucratic systems and understand educational material that was not presented in their native language. However, as technology began to advance, I realized that there were tools available that could help bridge these gaps and make vital information more accessible.

Through the use of various apps and websites that offer simplified explanations of complex topics, individuals can better understand educational material and navigate complicated bureaucratic systems with ease. These technological tools have the potential to break down barriers and provide access to information that was once difficult to obtain. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning can help bridge language barriers, making information accessible to non-native speakers.

As a computer science student, I am excited about the potential of technology to make education and information more accessible to disadvantaged communities. By combining education and technology, we can empower individuals and communities with the knowledge and resources they need to thrive. I am committed to exploring and developing solutions to these issues.

One of the most pressing issues facing disadvantaged communities is the lack of access to quality education and resources. Investing in education, healthcare, and other basic services is crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty, inequality, and conflict caused by war, according to the United Nations Development Programme. As a computer science student, I am dedicated to using my skills to empower families who may be struggling and provide them with the resources they need to succeed. Technology can be particularly useful in assisting disadvantaged families by simplifying technical jargon and resources, making it easier for families to access and understand critical information.

My family's experience fleeing Laos during the Vietnam War reinforces my belief that education is a powerful tool that can empower individuals and communities alike. Research shows that it can take generations for a community impacted by war to fully recover and thrive. The disruption of education not only affects individual children's opportunities but can also have long-term consequences for the overall development of a community.

As a Hmong American, I am acutely aware of the challenges that immigrant families face when adapting to a new culture and navigating complex systems. The language barrier can be a significant hurdle, as well as the cultural differences that can create misunderstandings and limit access to critical information. Through technology and education, we can help bridge these gaps and empower individuals and communities to succeed.

This underscores the importance of education in post-conflict reconstruction efforts and the crucial role of individuals who are committed to using their skills to empower communities and facilitate positive change. As a computer science student, I am honored to be part of a generation that has the potential to make a positive impact on the world through the use of technology and education. I am committed to using my skills to contribute to this goal by developing tools and resources that can help break down barriers and provide access to information for all.

In conclusion, my personal experiences as a second-generation educated female in a Hmong American family have shaped my beliefs about the power of education and technology to transform the lives of individuals and communities. Through the use of innovative solutions and a commitment to empowering those who are most in need, we can create a more equitable and just society that values education, inclusivity, and compassion. As a computer science student, I am excited about the potential of technology to make a positive impact in the world and I am committed to using my skills to make a difference.</p>
